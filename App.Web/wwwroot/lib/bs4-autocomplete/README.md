## BS4-AUTOCOMPLETE


### About

Simple to use and lightweight autocomplete/typeahead for Bootstrap 4 and jQuery.

It uses the default Dropdown component from Bootstrap 4 to create the list of autocomplete items.

Originally, I expanded the capabilities of the honatas / bootstrap-4-autocomplete component, but I decided to make my own project out of it.
